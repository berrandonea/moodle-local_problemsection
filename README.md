A "problem section" is a special section in a Moodle course. It always contains an assignment, that a few student teams will take.
To work together, these students can be given various collaboration tools : a forum, a chat, an etherpad-lite module if you have this plugin on your Moodle, a wiki, ...

Of course, all of these tools already exist on Moodle without local_problemsection. What changes here is that you don't have to spend an hour to create the section, 
the grouping, the groups, the modules, set the modules to work with the grouping, and so on ... (most teachers wouldn't do it, anyway).
No : a few clicks and it's done. And no risk to forget one of these steps.

Once this plugin is installed, a new item appears in your Course administration menu : Problem sections.
Clicking this item opens a screen showing the problem sections available in the course, allowing you to manage them, create new ones, change the groups or jump to the submissions.

Creating a new problem section always generates a new grouping. But the groups in this grouping can be new ones (just tell how many you want) or they can be existing 
groups from another grouping. This way, once your teams are set, you can give them several problem sections.
